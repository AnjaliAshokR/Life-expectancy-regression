# Life-expectancy-regression
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project that predicts life expectancy using various demographic and economic factors. The project is implemented in R and utilizes various supervised learning algorithms to build the prediction model.

## Requirements
- R (version 3.6 or later)
- R Studio (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages : tidyverse
- 
## Data
The data used in this project is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and contains information on life expectancy, income, education, and other demographic factors for various countries. The data is provided in CSV format with the data descriptions.

## Code
The code for the project is provided in the regression_model.R file. There is also a markdown file with some detailed analysis.

## Running the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in R Studio.
- Run the regression_model.R file to train the models and prediction using them.
- Run the Life_expectancy.Rmd file for the markdown file with some analysis.
- 
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive example of how to use machine learning techniques in R to predict life expectancy using various demographic and economic factors. The code and data provided in this repository can be used as a starting point for further research or for building similar prediction models for other datasets.
